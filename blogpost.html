													"Passion has little to do with euphoria and everything to do with patience. It is not about feeling good. It is about endurance. Like patience, passion comes from the same Latin root: pati. It does not mean to flow with exuberance. It means to suffer" (Mark Z. Danielewski - House of Leaves).

													I thought I'd share because passion is one of the more amiguous topics on this blog and I this might help explain what it means to me. This section is where I want to talk about my struggles in the pursuit of success and happiness; and the beauty <i>and</i> ugly in all of it.
